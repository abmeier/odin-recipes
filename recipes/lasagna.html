<p> From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes.</p>


<p>There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found necessary, for example adding a dash of wine vinegar to the sauce and changing the amount of Parmesan cheese.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>cheese</li>
    <li>beef</li>
    <li>tomato sauce</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>bake the beef</li>
    <li>add the sauce</li>
    <li>add the cheese</li>
    <li>put in stove</li>
</ol>
